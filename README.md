# i3wl
A simple applet for navigating through windows in [i3wm](https://i3wm.org/).

When you start nesting tabbed, stacked and tiling layouts on several
workspaces, remembering the position of a window can be difficult if not
impossible.

This applet shows an icon in the tray. Clicking on it shows a menu listing
the workspaces, each of them containing the list of windows in that
workspace. By clicking on a item the focus is raised on the corresponding
window.
